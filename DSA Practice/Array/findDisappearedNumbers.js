The "Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array" problem requires finding all the numbers between 1 and `n` (where `n` is the size of the array) that do not appear in the array. The array is unsorted and contains integers between 1 and `n`, with some numbers possibly appearing more than once.

### Approach:
You can solve this problem efficiently with an in-place modification approach:

1. **Mark the presence of each number:** 
   - Iterate through the array, and for each number, mark the corresponding index (i.e., the index equal to `number - 1`) as visited by negating the value at that index.
   - If the number `x` is present, mark `arr[x - 1]` as negative to indicate that `x` is present in the array.
   
2. **Identify missing numbers:**
   - After marking, any index that contains a positive number indicates that the index + 1 (the original number) is missing from the array.

3. **Return the missing numbers:** 
   - Collect all indices where the value is positive and add `index + 1` to the result list.

### JavaScript Implementation:

```javascript
function findDisappearedNumbers(nums) {
    let result = [];

    // Mark each number's corresponding index as visited
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        let index = Math.abs(nums[i]) - 1;
        if (nums[index] > 0) {
            nums[index] = -nums[index];
        }
    }

    // Identify the indices that were not visited (i.e., remain positive)
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] > 0) {
            result.push(i + 1);
        }
    }

    return result;
}
```

### Example:

```javascript
let array = [4, 3, 2, 7, 8, 2, 3, 1];
console.log(findDisappearedNumbers(array)); // Output: [5, 6]
```

### Explanation:
- **Initial Array:** `[4, 3, 2, 7, 8, 2, 3, 1]`
- **Marking Process:** 
  - When processing `4`, mark `nums[3]` as negative.
  - Continue this for all elements, resulting in the array `[-4, -3, -2, -7, 8, 2, -3, -1]`.
- **Finding Missing Numbers:** 
  - Index `4` and `5` contain positive numbers (`8` and `2`), so the missing numbers are `5` and `6`.

### Edge Cases:
- If the array is empty, return an empty list.
- If all numbers from `1` to `n` are present, return an empty list.

### Space and Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - The array is traversed twice, leading to linear time complexity.
  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
  - The algorithm modifies the array in place and uses only a constant amount of extra space.

### Summary:
This approach efficiently finds all missing numbers in the array with linear time complexity and constant space complexity, making it an optimal solution for this problem. By using the array itself to mark the presence of numbers, you avoid the need for extra storage.
