//Heap and stack memory


/*


Stack and heap are two areas in memory where data is stored. The stack is used for static memory allocation, while the heap is used for dynamic memory allocation.

Static memory allocation means that the size and location of the memory is fixed at compile time, while dynamic memory allocation means that the size and location of the memory can change at runtime.

In JavaScript, primitive values (such as numbers, strings, booleans, etc.) are stored in the stack, while objects (such as arrays, functions, etc.) are stored in the heap.

Primitive values are immutable and have a fixed size, so they can be easily stored and accessed in the stack. Objects are mutable and have a variable size, so they need to be stored and accessed in the heap, which is more flexible but also slower.
